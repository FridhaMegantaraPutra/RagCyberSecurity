    "description": "get-jwks contains fetch utils for JWKS keys. In versions prior to 11.0.2, a vulnerability in get-jwks can lead to cache poisoning in the JWKS key-fetching mechanism. When the iss (issuer) claim is validated only after keys are retrieved from the cache, it is possible for cached keys from an unexpected issuer to be reused, resulting in a bypass of issuer validation. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a pair of JWTs, the first one ensuring that a chosen public key is fetched and stored in the shared JWKS cache, and the second one leveraging that cached key to pass signature validation for a targeted iss value. The vulnerability will work only if the iss validation is done after the use of get-jwks for keys retrieval. This issue has been patched in version 11.0.2.",

The Control and Status Register (CSR) logic has a flawed interaction between exception handling and exception return (MRET) mechanisms which can cause faulty trap behavior. When the MRET instruction is executed in machine mode without being in an exception state, an Instruction Access Fault may be triggered. This results in both the exception handling logic and the exception return logic activating simultaneously, leading to conflicting updates to the control and status registers.",

The application returns distinguishable responses for valid and invalid email addresses, allowing unauthenticated attackers to determine the existence of user accounts.

In versions prior to 4.2, no such user-level protection is in place, only basic IP-based rate limiting is enforced. This IP-based protection can be bypassed by distributing requests across multiple IPs (e.g., rotating IP or proxies). Effectively bypassing both login and password reset security controls.

Versions between 2.1.0 and 2.14.19, 3.2.0-rc1, 3.1.0-rc1 through 3.1.7, and 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.0.18 contain a race condition in the repository credentials handler that can cause the Argo CD server to panic and crash when concurrent operations are performed on the same repository URL. The vulnerability is located in numerous repository related handlers in the util/db/repository_secrets.go file. A valid API token with repositories resource permissions (create, update, or delete actions) is required to trigger the race condition. This vulnerability causes the entire Argo CD server to crash and become unavailable. Attackers can repeatedly and continuously trigger the race condition to maintain a denial-of-service state, disrupting all GitOps operations. This issue is fixed in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19.",

NOTE: the reporter indicates that the \"behavior was observed sporadically\" during \"limited time on the client site,\" making it not \"possible to gain more information about the specific kiosk mode crashing issue,\" and the only conclusion was \"there appears to be some form of race condition.\" Accordingly, there can be doubt that a reproducible cybersecurity vulnerability was identified; sporadic software crashes can also be caused by a hardware fault on a single device (for example, transient RAM errors). The reporter also describes a variety of other issues, including initial access via USB because of the absence of a \"lock-pick resistant locking solution for the External Controller PC cabinet,\" which is not a cybersecurity vulnerability (section 4.1.5 of the CNA Operational Rules). Finally, it is unclear whether the device or OS configuration was inappropriate, given that the risks are typically limited to insider threats within the mail operations room of a large company.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni40e: remove read access to debugfs files\n\nThe 'command' and 'netdev_ops' debugfs files are a legacy debugging\ninterface supported by the i40e driver since its early days by commit\n02e9c290814c (\"i40e: debugfs interface\").\n\nBoth of these debugfs files provide a read handler which is mostly useless,\nand which is implemented with questionable logic. They both use a static\n256 byte buffer which is initialized to the empty string. In the case of\nthe 'command' file this buffer is literally never used and simply wastes\nspace. In the case of the 'netdev_ops' file, the last command written is\nsaved here.\n\nOn read, the files contents are presented as the name of the device\nfollowed by a colon and then the contents of their respective static\nbuffer. For 'command' this will always be \"<device>: \". For 'netdev_ops',\nthis will be \"<device>: <last command written>\". But note the buffer is\nshared between all devices operated by this module. At best, it is mostly\nmeaningless information, and at worse it could be accessed simultaneously\nas there doesn't appear to be any locking mechanism.\n\nWe have also recently received multiple reports for both read functions\nabout their use of snprintf and potential overflow that could result in\nreading arbitrary kernel memory. For the 'command' file, this is definitely\nimpossible, since the static buffer is always zero and never written to.\nFor the 'netdev_ops' file, it does appear to be possible, if the user\ncarefully crafts the command input, it will be copied into the buffer,\nwhich could be large enough to cause snprintf to truncate, which then\ncauses the copy_to_user to read beyond the length of the buffer allocated\nby kzalloc.\n\nA minimal fix would be to replace snprintf() with scnprintf() which would\ncap the return to the number of bytes written, preventing an overflow. A\nmore involved fix would be to drop the mostly useless static buffers,\nsaving 512 bytes and modifying the read functions to stop needing those as\ninput.\n\nInstead, lets just completely drop the read access to these files. These\nare debug interfaces exposed as part of debugfs, and I don't believe that\ndropping read access will break any script, as the provided output is\npretty useless. You can find the netdev name through other more standard\ninterfaces, and the 'netdev_ops' interface can easily result in garbage if\nyou issue simultaneous writes to multiple devices at once.\n\nIn order to properly remove the i40e_dbg_netdev_ops_buf, we need to\nrefactor its write function to avoid using the static buffer. Instead, use\nthe same logic as the i40e_dbg_command_write, with an allocated buffer.\nUpdate the code to use this instead of the static buffer, and ensure we\nfree the buffer on exit. This fixes simultaneous writes to 'netdev_ops' on\nmultiple devices, and allows us to remove the now unused static buffer\nalong with removing the read access.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phylink: add lock for serializing concurrent pl->phydev writes with resolver\n\nCurrently phylink_resolve() protects itself against concurrent\nphylink_bringup_phy() or phylink_disconnect_phy() calls which modify\npl->phydev by relying on pl->state_mutex.\n\nThe problem is that in phylink_resolve(), pl->state_mutex is in a lock\ninversion state with pl->phydev->lock. So pl->phydev->lock needs to be\nacquired prior to pl->state_mutex. But that requires dereferencing\npl->phydev in the first place, and without pl->state_mutex, that is\nracy.\n\nHence the reason for the extra lock. Currently it is redundant, but it\nwill serve a functional purpose once mutex_lock(&phy->lock) will be\nmoved outside of the mutex_lock(&pl->state_mutex) section.\n\nAnother alternative considered would have been to let phylink_resolve()\nacquire the rtnl_mutex, which is also held when phylink_bringup_phy()\nand phylink_disconnect_phy() are called. But since phylink_disconnect_phy()\nruns under rtnl_lock(), it would deadlock with phylink_resolve() when\ncalling flush_work(&pl->resolve). Additionally, it would have been\nundesirable because it would have unnecessarily blocked many other call\npaths as well in the entire kernel, so the smaller-scoped lock was\npreferred.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: transfer phy_config_inband() locking responsibility to phylink\n\nProblem description\n===================\n\nLockdep reports a possible circular locking dependency (AB/BA) between\n&pl->state_mutex and &phy->lock, as follows.\n\nphylink_resolve() // acquires &pl->state_mutex\n-> phylink_major_config()\n   -> phy_config_inband() // acquires &pl->phydev->lock\n\nwhereas all the other call sites where &pl->state_mutex and\n&pl->phydev->lock have the locking scheme reversed. Everywhere else,\n&pl->phydev->lock is acquired at the top level, and &pl->state_mutex at\nthe lower level. A clear example is phylink_bringup_phy().\n\nThe outlier is the newly introduced phy_config_inband() and the existing\nlock order is the correct one. To understand why it cannot be the other\nway around, it is sufficient to consider phylink_phy_change(), phylink's\ncallback from the PHY device's phy->phy_link_change() virtual method,\ninvoked by the PHY state machine.\n\nphy_link_up() and phy_link_down(), the (indirect) callers of\nphylink_phy_change(), are called with &phydev->lock acquired.\nThen phylink_phy_change() acquires its own &pl->state_mutex, to\nserialize changes made to its pl->phy_state and pl->link_config.\nSo all other instances of &pl->state_mutex and &phydev->lock must be\nconsistent with this order.\n\nProblem impact\n==============\n\nI think the kernel runs a serious deadlock risk if an existing\nphylink_resolve() thread, which results in a phy_config_inband() call,\nis concurrent with a phy_link_up() or phy_link_down() call, which will\ndeadlock on &pl->state_mutex in phylink_phy_change(). Practically\nspeaking, the impact may be limited by the slow speed of the medium\nauto-negotiation protocol, which makes it unlikely for the current state\nto still be unresolved when a new one is detected, but I think the\nproblem is there. Nonetheless, the problem was discovered using lockdep.\n\nProposed solution\n=================\n\nPractically speaking, the phy_config_inband() requirement of having\nphydev->lock acquired must transfer to the caller (phylink is the only\ncaller). There, it must bubble up until immediately before\n&pl->state_mutex is acquired, for the cases where that takes place.\n\nSolution details, considerations, notes\n=======================================\n\nThis is the phy_config_inband() call graph:\n\n                          sfp_upstream_ops :: connect_phy()\n                          |\n                          v\n                          phylink_sfp_connect_phy()\n                          |\n                          v\n                          phylink_sfp_config_phy()\n                          |\n                          |   sfp_upstream_ops :: module_insert()\n                          |   |\n                          |   v\n                          |   phylink_sfp_module_insert()\n                          |   |\n                          |   |   sfp_upstream_ops :: module_start()\n                          |   |   |\n                          |   |   v\n                          |   |   phylink_sfp_module_start()\n                          |   |   |\n                          |   v   v\n                          |   phylink_sfp_config_optical()\n phylink_start()          |   |\n   |   phylink_resume()   v   v\n   |   |  phylink_sfp_set_config()\n   |   |  |\n   v   v  v\n phylink_mac_initial_config()\n   |   phylink_resolve()\n   |   |  phylink_ethtool_ksettings_set()\n   v   v  v\n   phylink_major_config()\n            |\n            v\n    phy_config_inband()\n\nphylink_major_config() caller #1, phylink_mac_initial_config(), does not\nacquire &pl->state_mutex nor do its callers.

This is often the case for remotely-controlled or\nremotely-powered BAM instances. In this case, we need to read num-channels\nfrom the DT to have all the necessary information to complete probing.\n\nHowever, at the moment invalid device trees without clock and without\nnum-channels still continue probing, because the error handling is missing\nreturn statements. The driver will then later try to read the number of\nchannels from the registers. This is unsafe, because it relies on boot\nfirmware and lucky timing to succeed. Unfortunately, the lack of proper\nerror handling here has been abused for several Qualcomm SoCs upstream,\ncausing early boot crashes in several situations [1, 2].\n\nAvoid these early crashes by erroring out when any of the required DT\nproperties are missing. Note that this will break some of the existing DTs\nupstream (mainly BAM instances related to the crypto engine). However,\nclearly these DTs have never been tested properly, since the error in the\nkernel log was just ignored.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix off-by-one errors in fast-commit block filling\n\nDue to several different off-by-one errors, or perhaps due to a late\nchange in design that wasn't fully reflected in the code that was\nactually merged, there are several very strange constraints on how\nfast-commit blocks are filled with tlv entries:\n\n- tlvs must start at least 10 bytes before the end of the block, even\n  though the minimum tlv length is 8.  Otherwise, the replay code will\n  ignore them.  (BUG: ext4_fc_reserve_space() could violate this\n  requirement if called with a len of blocksize - 9 or blocksize - 8.\n  Fortunately, this doesn't seem to happen currently.)\n\n- tlvs must end at least 1 byte before the end of the block.  Otherwise\n  the replay code will consider them to be invalid.  This quirk\n  contributed to a bug (fixed by an earlier commit) where uninitialized\n  memory was being leaked to disk in the last byte of blocks.\n\nAlso, strangely these constraints don't apply to the replay code in\ne2fsprogs, which will accept any tlvs in the blocks (with no bounds\nchecks at all, but that is a separate issue...).\n\nGiven that this all seems to be a bug, let's fix it by just filling\nblocks with tlv entries in the natural way.\n\nNote that old kernels will be unable to replay fast-commit journals\ncreated by kernels that have this commit.",

Memory allocated for page table entries\nnot released during process termination. This issue can be reproduced by\na small program that allocates a large amount of memory. After several\nruns, you'll see that the amount of free memory has reduced and will\ncontinue to reduce after each run. All ARC CPUs are effected by this\nissue. The issue was introduced since the kernel stable release v5.15-rc1.\n\nAs described in commit d9820ff after switch pgtable_t back to struct\npage *, a pointer to \"struct page\" and appropriate functions are used to\nallocate and free a memory page for PTEs, but the pmd_pgtable macro hasn't\nchanged and returns the direct virtual address from the PMD (PGD) entry.\nThan this address used as a parameter in the __pte_free() and as a result\nthis function couldn't release memory page allocated for PTEs.\n\nFix this issue by changing the pmd_pgtable macro and returning pointer to\nstruct page.",

That function is\ninvoked by kworker, which doesn't take any signals. Because of that, it\ndoesn't really matter if we wait for completions in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE\nor TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state. However, it does matter to the hung task\ndetection checker!\n\nNormally we expect cancelations and completions to happen rather\nquickly. Some test cases, however, will exit the ring and park the\nowning task stopped (eg via SIGSTOP). If the owning task needs to run\ntask_work to complete requests, then io_ring_exit_work won't make any\nprogress until the task is runnable again. Hence io_ring_exit_work can\ntrigger the hung task detection, which is particularly problematic if\npanic-on-hung-task is enabled.\n\nAs the ring exit doesn't take signals to begin with, have it wait\ninterruptibly rather than uninterruptibly. io_uring has a separate\nstuck-exit warning that triggers independently anyway, so we're not\nreally missing anything by making this switch.",

The difference between these two stats tracks\nthe number of bytes currently sitting on the physical NIC. ibmvnic\nincreases the number of queued bytes though calls to\nnetdev_tx_sent_queue() in the drivers xmit function. When, VIOS reports\nthat it is done transmitting bytes, the ibmvnic device increases the\nnumber of completed bytes through calls to netdev_tx_completed_queue().\nIt is important to note that the driver batches its transmit calls and\nnum_queued is increased every time that an skb is added to the next\nbatch, not necessarily when the batch is sent to VIOS for transmission.\n\nUnlike other reset types, a NON FATAL reset will not flush the sub crq\ntx buffers. Therefore, it is possible for the batched skb array to be\npartially full. So if there is call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when\nre-opening the device, the value of num_queued (0) would not account\nfor the skb's that are currently batched. Eventually, when the batch\nis sent to VIOS, the call to netdev_tx_completed_queue() would increase\nnum_completed to a value greater than the num_queued. This causes a\nBUG_ON crash:\n\nibmvnic 30000002: Firmware reports error, cause: adapter problem.\nStarting recovery...\nibmvnic 30000002: tx error 600\nibmvnic 30000002: tx error 600\nibmvnic 30000002: tx error 600\nibmvnic 30000002: tx error 600\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nkernel BUG at lib/dynamic_queue_limits.c:27!\nOops: Exception in kernel mode, sig: 5\n[....]\nNIP dql_completed+0x28/0x1c0\nLR ibmvnic_complete_tx.isra.0+0x23c/0x420 [ibmvnic]\nCall Trace:\nibmvnic_complete_tx.isra.0+0x3f8/0x420 [ibmvnic] (unreliable)\nibmvnic_interrupt_tx+0x40/0x70 [ibmvnic]\n__handle_irq_event_percpu+0x98/0x270\n---[ end trace ]---\n\nTherefore, do not reset the dql stats when performing a NON_FATAL reset.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlib: cpu_rmap: Avoid use after free on rmap->obj array entries\n\nWhen calling irq_set_affinity_notifier() with NULL at the notify\nargument, it will cause freeing of the glue pointer in the\ncorresponding array entry but will leave the pointer in the array. A\nsubsequent call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() will try to free this entry again\nleading to possible use after free.\n\nFix that by setting NULL to the array entry and checking that we have\nnon-zero at the array entry when iterating over the array in\nfree_irq_cpu_rmap().\n\nThe current code does not suffer from this since there are no cases\nwhere irq_set_affinity_notifier(irq, NULL) (note the NULL passed for the\nnotify arg) is called, followed by a call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() so we\ndon't hit and issue. Subsequent patches in this series excersize this\nflow, hence the required fix.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp/udp: Fix memleaks of sk and zerocopy skbs with TX timestamp.\n\nsyzkaller reported [0] memory leaks of an UDP socket and ZEROCOPY\nskbs.  We can reproduce the problem with these sequences:\n\n  sk = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)\n  sk.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_TIMESTAMPING, SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE)\n  sk.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_ZEROCOPY, 1)\n  sk.sendto(b'', MSG_ZEROCOPY, ('127.0.0.1', 53))\n  sk.close()\n\nsendmsg() calls msg_zerocopy_alloc(), which allocates a skb, sets\nskb->cb->ubuf.refcnt to 1, and calls sock_hold().  Here, struct\nubuf_info_msgzc indirectly holds a refcnt of the socket.  When the\nskb is sent, __skb_tstamp_tx() clones it and puts the clone into\nthe socket's error queue with the TX timestamp.\n\nWhen the original skb is received locally, skb_copy_ubufs() calls\nskb_unclone(), and pskb_expand_head() increments skb->cb->ubuf.refcnt.\nThis additional count is decremented while freeing the skb, but struct\nubuf_info_msgzc still has a refcnt, so __msg_zerocopy_callback() is\nnot called.\n\nThe last refcnt is not released unless we retrieve the TX timestamped\nskb by recvmsg().  Since we clear the error queue in inet_sock_destruct()\nafter the socket's refcnt reaches 0, there is a circular dependency.\nIf we close() the socket holding such skbs, we never call sock_put()\nand leak the count, sk, and skb.\n\nTCP has the same problem, and commit e0c8bccd40fc (\"net: stream:\npurge sk_error_queue in sk_stream_kill_queues()\") tried to fix it\nby calling skb_queue_purge() during close().  However, there is a\nsmall chance that skb queued in a qdisc or device could be put\ninto the error queue after the skb_queue_purge() call.\n\nIn __skb_tstamp_tx(), the cloned skb should not have a reference\nto the ubuf to remove the circular dependency, but skb_clone() does\nnot call skb_copy_ubufs() for zerocopy skb.  So, we need to call\nskb_orphan_frags_rx() for the cloned skb to call skb_copy_ubufs().\n\n[0]:\nBUG: memory leak\nunreferenced object 0xffff88800c6d2d00 (size 1152):\n  comm \"syz-executor392\", pid 264, jiffies 4294785440 (age 13.044s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 cd af e8 81 00 00 00 00  ................\n    02 00 07 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ...@............\n  backtrace:\n    [<0000000055636812>] sk_prot_alloc+0x64/0x2a0 net/core/sock.c:2024\n    [<0000000054d77b7a>] sk_alloc+0x3b/0x800 net/core/sock.c:2083\n    [<0000000066f3c7e0>] inet_create net/ipv4/af_inet.c:319 [inline]\n    [<0000000066f3c7e0>] inet_create+0x31e/0xe40 net/ipv4/af_inet.c:245\n    [<000000009b83af97>] __sock_create+0x2ab/0x550 net/socket.c:1515\n    [<00000000b9b11231>] sock_create net/socket.c:1566 [inline]\n    [<00000000b9b11231>] __sys_socket_create net/socket.c:1603 [inline]\n    [<00000000b9b11231>] __sys_socket_create net/socket.c:1588 [inline]\n    [<00000000b9b11231>] __sys_socket+0x138/0x250 net/socket.c:1636\n    [<000000004fb45142>] __do_sys_socket net/socket.c:1649 [inline]\n    [<000000004fb45142>] __se_sys_socket net/socket.c:1647 [inline]\n    [<000000004fb45142>] __x64_sys_socket+0x73/0xb0 net/socket.c:1647\n    [<0000000066999e0e>] do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline]\n    [<0000000066999e0e>] do_syscall_64+0x38/0x90 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80\n    [<0000000017f238c1>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\nBUG: memory leak\nunreferenced object 0xffff888017633a00 (size 240):\n  comm \"syz-executor392\", pid 264, jiffies 4294785440 (age 13.044s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2d 6d 0c 80 88 ff ff  .........-m.....\n  backtrace:\n    [<000000002b1c4368>] __alloc_skb+0x229/0x320 net/core/skbuff.c:497\n    [<00000000143579a6>] alloc_skb include/linux/skbuff.h:1265 [inline]\n    [<00000000143579a6>] sock_omalloc+0xaa/0x190 net/core/sock.c:2596\n    [<00000000be626478>] msg_zerocopy_alloc net/core/skbuff.c:1294 [inline]\n    [<00000000be626478>]\n---truncated---",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: vsp1: Replace vb2_is_streaming() with vb2_start_streaming_called()\n\nThe vsp1 driver uses the vb2_is_streaming() function in its .buf_queue()\nhandler to check if the .start_streaming() operation has been called,\nand decide whether to just add the buffer to an internal queue, or also\ntrigger a hardware run. vb2_is_streaming() relies on the vb2_queue\nstructure's streaming field, which used to be set only after calling the\n.start_streaming() operation.\n\nCommit a10b21532574 (\"media: vb2: add (un)prepare_streaming queue ops\")\nchanged this, setting the .streaming field in vb2_core_streamon() before\nenqueuing buffers to the driver and calling .start_streaming().

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: allow ext4_get_group_info() to fail\n\nPreviously, ext4_get_group_info() would treat an invalid group number\nas BUG(), since in theory it should never happen.  However, if a\nmalicious attaker (or fuzzer) modifies the superblock via the block\ndevice while it is the file system is mounted, it is possible for\ns_first_data_block to get set to a very large number.  In that case,\nwhen calculating the block group of some block number (such as the\nstarting block of a preallocation region), could result in an\nunderflow and very large block group number.  Then the BUG_ON check in\next4_get_group_info() would fire, resutling in a denial of service\nattack that can be triggered by root or someone with write access to\nthe block device.\n\nFor a quality of implementation perspective, it's best that even if\nthe system administrator does something that they shouldn't, that it\nwill not trigger a BUG.  So instead of BUG'ing, ext4_get_group_info()\nwill call ext4_error and return NULL.  We also add fallback code in\nall of the callers of ext4_get_group_info() that it might NULL.\n\nAlso, since ext4_get_group_info() was already borderline to be an\ninline function, un-inline it.  The results in a next reduction of the\ncompiled text size of ext4 by roughly 2k.",

Hence, this suppose NLA_S32 (4 bytes) integer\ncan be faked as empty (0 bytes) by a malicious user, which could leads\nto OOB in heap just like CVE-2023-3773.\n\nTo fix it, this commit just completes the nla_policy description for\nIFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: gs_usb: fix time stamp counter initialization\n\nIf the gs_usb device driver is unloaded (or unbound) before the\ninterface is shut down, the USB stack first calls the struct\nusb_driver::disconnect and then the struct net_device_ops::ndo_stop\ncallback.\n\nIn gs_usb_disconnect() all pending bulk URBs are killed, i.e. no more\nRX'ed CAN frames are send from the USB device to the host. Later in\ngs_can_close() a reset control message is send to each CAN channel to\nremove the controller from the CAN bus. In this race window the USB\ndevice can still receive CAN frames from the bus and internally queue\nthem to be send to the host.\n\nAt least in the current version of the candlelight firmware, the queue\nof received CAN frames is not emptied during the reset command. After\nloading (or binding) the gs_usb driver, new URBs are submitted during\nthe struct net_device_ops::ndo_open callback and the candlelight\nfirmware starts sending its already queued CAN frames to the host.\n\nHowever, this scenario was not considered when implementing the\nhardware timestamp function. The cycle counter/time counter\ninfrastructure is set up (gs_usb_timestamp_init()) after the USBs are\nsubmitted, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference if\ntimecounter_cyc2time() (via the call chain:\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() -> gs_usb_set_timestamp() ->\ngs_usb_skb_set_timestamp()) is called too early.\n\nMove the gs_usb_timestamp_init() function before the URBs are\nsubmitted to fix this problem.\n\nFor a comprehensive solution, we need to consider gs_usb devices with\nmore than 1 channel. The cycle counter/time counter infrastructure is\nsetup per channel, but the RX URBs are per device. Once gs_can_open()\nof _a_ channel has been called, and URBs have been submitted, the\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() can be called for _all_ available\nchannels, even for channels that are not running, yet. As cycle\ncounter/time counter has not set up, this will again lead to a NULL\npointer dereference.\n\nConvert the cycle counter/time counter from a \"per channel\" to a \"per\ndevice\" functionality. Also set it up, before submitting any URBs to\nthe device.\n\nFurther in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(), don't process any URBs for\nnot started CAN channels, only resubmit the URB.",

Due to this, programs compiled for Cygwin that validate paths could misbehave, potentially allowing path traversal attacks or malicious filesystem operations.\n\n\n\n\nRust 1.89.0 fixes the issue by handling both Win32 and Unix style paths in the standard library for the Cygwin target.\n\n\n\nWhile we assess the severity of this vulnerability as \"medium\", please note that the tier 3 Cygwin compilation target is only available when building it from source: no pre-built binaries are distributed by the Rust project, and it cannot be installed through Rustup. Unless you manually compiled the `x86_64-pc-cygwin` target you are not affected by this vulnerability. Users of the tier 1 MinGW target (`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`) are also explicitly not affected.",

No per-user salt is used and the fast hash algorithms are unsuitable for password storage. An attacker who obtains the password database can recover cleartext passwords via offline dictionary or rainbow table attacks. The vulnerable code also contains logic that migrates legacy SHA-1 hashes to SHA-512 on login, further exposing users still on the old hash. This vulnerability was partially resolved, but still present within the legacy authentication platform.",

Workspaces allow users to open more than a single folder and save specific settings (pretty similar to .vscode/settings.json) for the folders / project. An untitled workspace is automatically created by VS Code (untitled.code-workspace), which contains all the folders and workspace settings from the user's current session, opening up an entire new attack vector if the user has a .code-workspace file in path (either untitled created automatically or a saved one). If an attacker is able to hijack the chat context of the victim (such as via a compromised MCP server), they can use prompt injection to make the Cursor Agent write into this file and modify the workspace. This leads to a bypass of CVE-2025-54130 which can lead to RCE by writing to the settings section. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: fix Rx page leak on multi-buffer frames\n\nThe ice_put_rx_mbuf() function handles calling ice_put_rx_buf() for each\nbuffer in the current frame. This function was introduced as part of\nhandling multi-buffer XDP support in the ice driver.\n\nIt works by iterating over the buffers from first_desc up to 1 plus the\ntotal number of fragments in the frame, cached from before the XDP program\nwas executed.\n\nIf the hardware posts a descriptor with a size of 0, the logic used in\nice_put_rx_mbuf() breaks. Such descriptors get skipped and don't get added\nas fragments in ice_add_xdp_frag. Since the buffer isn't counted as a\nfragment, we do not iterate over it in ice_put_rx_mbuf(), and thus we don't\ncall ice_put_rx_buf().\n\nBecause we don't call ice_put_rx_buf(), we don't attempt to re-use the\npage or free it. This leaves a stale page in the ring, as we don't\nincrement next_to_alloc.\n\nThe ice_reuse_rx_page() assumes that the next_to_alloc has been incremented\nproperly, and that it always points to a buffer with a NULL page. Since\nthis function doesn't check, it will happily recycle a page over the top\nof the next_to_alloc buffer, losing track of the old page.\n\nNote that this leak only occurs for multi-buffer frames. The\nice_put_rx_mbuf() function always handles at least one buffer, so a\nsingle-buffer frame will always get handled correctly. It is not clear\nprecisely why the hardware hands us descriptors with a size of 0 sometimes,\nbut it happens somewhat regularly with \"jumbo frames\" used by 9K MTU.\n\nTo fix ice_put_rx_mbuf(), we need to make sure to call ice_put_rx_buf() on\nall buffers between first_desc and next_to_clean. Borrow the logic of a\nsimilar function in i40e used for this same purpose. Use the same logic\nalso in ice_get_pgcnts().\n\nInstead of iterating over just the number of fragments, use a loop which\niterates until the current index reaches to the next_to_clean element just\npast the current frame. Unlike i40e, the ice_put_rx_mbuf() function does\ncall ice_put_rx_buf() on the last buffer of the frame indicating the end of\npacket.\n\nFor non-linear (multi-buffer) frames, we need to take care when adjusting\nthe pagecnt_bias. An XDP program might release fragments from the tail of\nthe frame, in which case that fragment page is already released. Only\nupdate the pagecnt_bias for the first descriptor and fragments still\nremaining post-XDP program. Take care to only access the shared info for\nfragmented buffers, as this avoids a significant cache miss.\n\nThe xdp_xmit value only needs to be updated if an XDP program is run, and\nonly once per packet. Drop the xdp_xmit pointer argument from\nice_put_rx_mbuf(). Instead, set xdp_xmit in the ice_clean_rx_irq() function\ndirectly. This avoids needing to pass the argument and avoids an extra\nbit-wise OR for each buffer in the frame.\n\nMove the increment of the ntc local variable to ensure its updated *before*\nall calls to ice_get_pgcnts() or ice_put_rx_mbuf(), as the loop logic\nrequires the index of the element just after the current frame.\n\nNow that we use an index pointer in the ring to identify the packet, we no\nlonger need to track or cache the number of fragments in the rx_ring.",

Root destruction waits for offline completion, but offline work is\n   blocked behind root destruction in cgroup_destroy_wq (max_active=1)\n\nSolution:\nSplit cgroup_destroy_wq into three dedicated workqueues:\ncgroup_offline_wq – Handles CSS offline operations\ncgroup_release_wq – Manages resource release\ncgroup_free_wq – Performs final memory deallocation\n\nThis separation eliminates blocking in the CSS free path while waiting for\noffline operations to complete.\n\n[1] https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/blob/master/runtest/controllers",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen/gntdev: Accommodate VMA splitting\n\nPrior to this commit, the gntdev driver code did not handle the\nfollowing scenario correctly with paravirtualized (PV) Xen domains:\n\n* User process sets up a gntdev mapping composed of two grant mappings\n  (i.e., two pages shared by another Xen domain).\n* User process munmap()s one of the pages.\n* User process munmap()s the remaining page.\n* User process exits.\n\nIn the scenario above, the user process would cause the kernel to log\nthe following messages in dmesg for the first munmap(), and the second\nmunmap() call would result in similar log messages:\n\n  BUG: Bad page map in process doublemap.test  pte:... pmd:...\n  page:0000000057c97bff refcount:1 mapcount:-1 \\\n    mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x0 pfn:...\n  ...\n  page dumped because: bad pte\n  ...\n  file:gntdev fault:0x0 mmap:gntdev_mmap [xen_gntdev] readpage:0x0\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x46/0x5e\n   print_bad_pte.cold+0x66/0xb6\n   unmap_page_range+0x7e5/0xdc0\n   unmap_vmas+0x78/0xf0\n   unmap_region+0xa8/0x110\n   __do_munmap+0x1ea/0x4e0\n   __vm_munmap+0x75/0x120\n   __x64_sys_munmap+0x28/0x40\n   do_syscall_64+0x38/0x90\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x61/0xcb\n   ...\n\nFor each munmap() call, the Xen hypervisor (if built with CONFIG_DEBUG)\nwould print out the following and trigger a general protection fault in\nthe affected Xen PV domain:\n\n  (XEN) d0v... Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...\n  (XEN) d0v... Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...\n\nAs of this writing, gntdev_grant_map structure's vma field (referred to\nas map->vma below) is mainly used for checking the start and end\naddresses of mappings. However, with split VMAs, these may change, and\nthere could be more than one VMA associated with a gntdev mapping.\nHence, remove the use of map->vma and rely on map->pages_vm_start for\nthe original start address and on (map->count << PAGE_SHIFT) for the\noriginal mapping size. Let the invalidate() and find_special_page()\nhooks use these.\n\nAlso, given that there can be multiple VMAs associated with a gntdev\nmapping, move the \"mmu_interval_notifier_remove(&map->notifier)\" call to\nthe end of gntdev_put_map, so that the MMU notifier is only removed\nafter the closing of the last remaining VMA.\n\nFinally, use an atomic to prevent inadvertent gntdev mapping re-use,\ninstead of using the map->live_grants atomic counter and/or the map->vma\npointer (the latter of which is now removed). This prevents the\nuserspace from mmap()'ing (with MAP_FIXED) a gntdev mapping over the\nsame address range as a previously set up gntdev mapping. This scenario\ncan be summarized with the following call-trace, which was valid prior\nto this commit:\n\n  mmap\n    gntdev_mmap\n  mmap (repeat mmap with MAP_FIXED over the same address range)\n    gntdev_invalidate\n      unmap_grant_pages (sets 'being_removed' entries to true)\n        gnttab_unmap_refs_async\n    unmap_single_vma\n    gntdev_mmap (maps the shared pages again)\n  munmap\n    gntdev_invalidate\n      unmap_grant_pages\n        (no-op because 'being_removed' entries are true)\n    unmap_single_vma (For PV domains, Xen reports that a granted page\n      is being unmapped and triggers a general protection fault in the\n      affected domain, if Xen was built with CONFIG_DEBUG)\n\nThe fix for this last scenario could be worth its own commit, but we\nopted for a single commit, because removing the gntdev_grant_map\nstructure's vma field requires guarding the entry to gntdev_mmap(), and\nthe live_grants atomic counter is not sufficient on its own to prevent\nthe mmap() over a pre-existing mapping.",

With the repair to use dev_kfree_skb_any(),\nkernel WARNINGs from skb_release_head_state() ceased\nand TCP/IP performance, as measured by iperf, was on\npar with expected results, approximately 20 Gb/s on\nAMD Milan based server.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: enetc: avoid buffer leaks on xdp_do_redirect() failure\n\nBefore enetc_clean_rx_ring_xdp() calls xdp_do_redirect(), each software\nBD in the RX ring between index orig_i and i can have one of 2 refcount\nvalues on its page.\n\nWe are the owner of the current buffer that is being processed, so the\nrefcount will be at least 1.\n\nIf the current owner of the buffer at the diametrically opposed index\nin the RX ring (i.o.w, the other half of this page) has not yet called\nkfree(), this page's refcount could even be 2.\n\nenetc_page_reusable() in enetc_flip_rx_buff() tests for the page\nrefcount against 1, and [ if it's 2 ] does not attempt to reuse it.\n\nBut if enetc_flip_rx_buff() is put after the xdp_do_redirect() call,\nthe page refcount can have one of 3 values. It can also be 0, if there\nis no owner of the other page half, and xdp_do_redirect() for this\nbuffer ran so far that it triggered a flush of the devmap/cpumap bulk\nqueue, and the consumers of those bulk queues also freed the buffer,\nall by the time xdp_do_redirect() returns the execution back to enetc.\n\nThis is the reason why enetc_flip_rx_buff() is called before\nxdp_do_redirect(), but there is a big flaw with that reasoning:\nenetc_flip_rx_buff() will set rx_swbd->page = NULL on both sides of the\nenetc_page_reusable() branch, and if xdp_do_redirect() returns an error,\nwe call enetc_xdp_free(), which does not deal gracefully with that.\n\nIn fact, what happens is quite special. The page refcounts start as 1.\nenetc_flip_rx_buff() figures they're reusable, transfers these\nrx_swbd->page pointers to a different rx_swbd in enetc_reuse_page(), and\nbumps the refcount to 2. When xdp_do_redirect() later returns an error,\nwe call the no-op enetc_xdp_free(), but we still haven't lost the\nreference to that page. A copy of it is still at rx_ring->next_to_alloc,\nbut that has refcount 2 (and there are no concurrent owners of it in\nflight, to drop the refcount). What really kills the system is when\nwe'll flip the rx_swbd->page the second time around. With an updated\nrefcount of 2, the page will not be reusable and we'll really leak it.\nThen enetc_new_page() will have to allocate more pages, which will then\neventually leak again on further errors from xdp_do_redirect().\n\nThe problem, summarized, is that we zeroize rx_swbd->page before we're\ncompletely done with it, and this makes it impossible for the error path\nto do something with it.\n\nSince the packet is potentially multi-buffer and therefore the\nrx_swbd->page is potentially an array, manual passing of the old\npointers between enetc_flip_rx_buff() and enetc_xdp_free() is a bit\ndifficult.\n\nFor the sake of going with a simple solution, we accept the possibility\nof racing with xdp_do_redirect(), and we move the flip procedure to\nexecute only on the redirect success path. By racing, I mean that the\npage may be deemed as not reusable by enetc (having a refcount of 0),\nbut there will be no leak in that case, either.\n\nOnce we accept that, we have something better to do with buffers on\nXDP_REDIRECT failure. Since we haven't performed half-page flipping yet,\nwe won't, either (and this way, we can avoid enetc_xdp_free()\ncompletely, which gives the entire page to the slab allocator).\nInstead, we'll call enetc_xdp_drop(), which will recycle this half of\nthe buffer back to the RX ring.",

(Note, these errors *shouldn't* happen; we're just\ntalking about what happens if they do anyway.)\n\nFix this by making blk_crypto_evict_key() unlink the key from the\nkeyslot management structures even on failure.\n\nAlso improve some comments.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ipset: Rework long task execution when adding/deleting entries\n\nWhen adding/deleting large number of elements in one step in ipset, it can\ntake a reasonable amount of time and can result in soft lockup errors. The\npatch 5f7b51bf09ba (\"netfilter: ipset: Limit the maximal range of\nconsecutive elements to add/delete\") tried to fix it by limiting the max\nelements to process at all. However it was not enough, it is still possible\nthat we get hung tasks. Lowering the limit is not reasonable, so the\napproach in this patch is as follows: rely on the method used at resizing\nsets and save the state when we reach a smaller internal batch limit,\nunlock/lock and proceed from the saved state. Thus we can avoid long\ncontinuous tasks and at the same time removed the limit to add/delete large\nnumber of elements in one step.\n\nThe nfnl mutex is held during the whole operation which prevents one to\nissue other ipset commands in parallel.",

For this bug, jbd2_journal_restart() is\ncalled by ocfs2_split_extent() during defragmenting.\n\nHow to fix\n\nFor ocfs2_split_extent() can handle journal operations totally by itself. \nCaller doesn't need to call journal access/dirty pair, and caller only\nneeds to call journal start/stop pair.  The fix method is to remove\njournal access/dirty from __ocfs2_move_extent().\n\nThe discussion for this patch:\nhttps://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/ocfs2-devel/2023-February/000647.html",

So when __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() checks\nthe ptr_ring, it will find it was not emptied and report a warning.\n\nAn alternative fix is to use __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() to drop these\npending frames or skbs when kthread_stop() returns -EINTR, but it may\nconfuse the user, because these frames or skbs have been handled\ncorrectly by XDP program. So instead of dropping these frames or skbs,\njust make sure the per-cpu kthread is running before\n__cpu_map_entry_alloc() returns.\n\nAfter apply the fix, the error handle for kthread_stop() will be\nunnecessary because it will always return 0, so just remove it.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: Gadget: core: Help prevent panic during UVC unconfigure\n\nAvichal Rakesh reported a kernel panic that occurred when the UVC\ngadget driver was removed from a gadget's configuration.  The panic\ninvolves a somewhat complicated interaction between the kernel driver\nand a userspace component (as described in the Link tag below), but\nthe analysis did make one thing clear: The Gadget core should\naccomodate gadget drivers calling usb_gadget_deactivate() as part of\ntheir unbind procedure.\n\nCurrently this doesn't work.  gadget_unbind_driver() calls\ndriver->unbind() while holding the udc->connect_lock mutex, and\nusb_gadget_deactivate() attempts to acquire that mutex, which will\nresult in a deadlock.\n\nThe simple fix is for gadget_unbind_driver() to release the mutex when\ninvoking the ->unbind() callback.  There is no particular reason for\nit to be holding the mutex at that time, and the mutex isn't held\nwhile the ->bind() callback is invoked.  So we'll drop the mutex\nbefore performing the unbind callback and reacquire it afterward.\n\nWe'll also add a couple of comments to usb_gadget_activate() and\nusb_gadget_deactivate().  Because they run in process context they\nmust not be called from a gadget driver's ->disconnect() callback,\nwhich (according to the kerneldoc for struct usb_gadget_driver in\ninclude/linux/usb/gadget.h) may run in interrupt context.  This may\nhelp prevent similar bugs from arising in the future.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: reject unhashed sockets in bpf_sk_assign\n\nThe semantics for bpf_sk_assign are as follows:\n\n    sk = some_lookup_func()\n    bpf_sk_assign(skb, sk)\n    bpf_sk_release(sk)\n\nThat is, the sk is not consumed by bpf_sk_assign. The function\ntherefore needs to make sure that sk lives long enough to be\nconsumed from __inet_lookup_skb. The path through the stack for a\nTCPv4 packet is roughly:\n\n  netif_receive_skb_core: takes RCU read lock\n    __netif_receive_skb_core:\n      sch_handle_ingress:\n        tcf_classify:\n          bpf_sk_assign()\n      deliver_ptype_list_skb:\n        deliver_skb:\n          ip_packet_type->func == ip_rcv:\n            ip_rcv_core:\n            ip_rcv_finish_core:\n              dst_input:\n                ip_local_deliver:\n                  ip_local_deliver_finish:\n                    ip_protocol_deliver_rcu:\n                      tcp_v4_rcv:\n                        __inet_lookup_skb:\n                          skb_steal_sock\n\nThe existing helper takes advantage of the fact that everything\nhappens in the same RCU critical section: for sockets with\nSOCK_RCU_FREE set bpf_sk_assign never takes a reference.\nskb_steal_sock then checks SOCK_RCU_FREE again and does sock_put\nif necessary.\n\nThis approach assumes that SOCK_RCU_FREE is never set on a sk\nbetween bpf_sk_assign and skb_steal_sock, but this invariant is\nviolated by unhashed UDP sockets. A new UDP socket is created\nin TCP_CLOSE state but without SOCK_RCU_FREE set. That flag is only\nadded in udp_lib_get_port() which happens when a socket is bound.\n\nWhen bpf_sk_assign was added it wasn't possible to access unhashed\nUDP sockets from BPF, so this wasn't a problem. This changed\nin commit 0c48eefae712 (\"sock_map: Lift socket state restriction\nfor datagram sockets\"), but the helper wasn't adjusted accordingly.\nThe following sequence of events will therefore lead to a refcount\nleak:\n\n1. Add socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM) to a sockmap.\n2. Pull socket out of sockmap and bpf_sk_assign it. Since\n   SOCK_RCU_FREE is not set we increment the refcount.\n3. bind() or connect() the socket, setting SOCK_RCU_FREE.\n4. skb_steal_sock will now set refcounted = false due to\n   SOCK_RCU_FREE.\n5. tcp_v4_rcv() skips sock_put().\n\nFix the problem by rejecting unhashed sockets in bpf_sk_assign().\nThis matches the behaviour of __inet_lookup_skb which is ultimately\nthe goal of bpf_sk_assign().",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: Fix multiple LUN_RESET handling\n\nThis fixes a bug where an initiator thinks a LUN_RESET has cleaned up\nrunning commands when it hasn't. The bug was added in commit 51ec502a3266\n(\"target: Delete tmr from list before processing\").\n\nThe problem occurs when:\n\n 1. We have N I/O cmds running in the target layer spread over 2 sessions.\n\n 2. The initiator sends a LUN_RESET for each session.\n\n 3. session1's LUN_RESET loops over all the running commands from both\n    sessions and moves them to its local drain_task_list.\n\n 4. session2's LUN_RESET does not see the LUN_RESET from session1 because\n    the commit above has it remove itself. session2 also does not see any\n    commands since the other reset moved them off the state lists.\n\n 5. sessions2's LUN_RESET will then complete with a successful response.\n\n 6. sessions2's inititor believes the running commands on its session are\n    now cleaned up due to the successful response and cleans up the running\n    commands from its side. It then restarts them.\n\n 7. The commands do eventually complete on the backend and the target\n    starts to return aborted task statuses for them. The initiator will\n    either throw a invalid ITT error or might accidentally lookup a new\n    task if the ITT has been reallocated already.\n\nFix the bug by reverting the patch, and serialize the execution of\nLUN_RESETs and Preempt and Aborts.\n\nAlso prevent us from waiting on LUN_RESETs in core_tmr_drain_tmr_list,\nbecause it turns out the original patch fixed a bug that was not\nmentioned. For LUN_RESET1 core_tmr_drain_tmr_list can see a second\nLUN_RESET and wait on it. Then the second reset will run\ncore_tmr_drain_tmr_list and see the first reset and wait on it resulting in\na deadlock.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: Fix deadlock in tc route query code\n\nCited commit causes ABBA deadlock[0] when peer flows are created while\nholding the devcom rw semaphore. Due to peer flows offload implementation\nthe lock is taken much higher up the call chain and there is no obvious way\nto easily fix the deadlock. Instead, since tc route query code needs the\npeer eswitch structure only to perform a lookup in xarray and doesn't\nperform any sleeping operations with it, refactor the code for lockless\nexecution in following ways:\n\n- RCUify the devcom 'data' pointer. When resetting the pointer\nsynchronously wait for RCU grace period before returning. This is fine\nsince devcom is currently only used for synchronization of\npairing/unpairing of eswitches which is rare and already expensive as-is.\n\n- Wrap all usages of 'paired' boolean in {READ|WRITE}_ONCE(). The flag has\nalready been used in some unlocked contexts without proper\nannotations (e.g. users of mlx5_devcom_is_paired() function), but it wasn't\nan issue since all relevant code paths checked it again after obtaining the\ndevcom semaphore.

This is documented\nin the read_folio section of Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst as:\n\n> The filesystem should unlock the folio once the read has completed,\n> whether it was successful or not.\n\nWithout this change, when fscache is in use and cache hit occurs during\na read, the page lock is leaked, producing the following stack on\nsubsequent reads (via mmap) to the page:\n\n$ cat /proc/3890/task/12864/stack\n[<0>] folio_wait_bit_common+0x124/0x350\n[<0>] filemap_read_folio+0xad/0xf0\n[<0>] filemap_fault+0x8b1/0xab0\n[<0>] __do_fault+0x39/0x150\n[<0>] do_fault+0x25c/0x3e0\n[<0>] __handle_mm_fault+0x6ca/0xc70\n[<0>] handle_mm_fault+0xe9/0x350\n[<0>] do_user_addr_fault+0x225/0x6c0\n[<0>] exc_page_fault+0x84/0x1b0\n[<0>] asm_exc_page_fault+0x27/0x30\n\nThis requires a reboot to resolve; it is a deadlock.\n\nNote however that the call to cifs_readpage_from_fscache does mark the\npage clean, but does not free the folio lock. This happens in\n__cifs_readpage_from_fscache on success. Releasing the lock at that\npoint however is not appropriate as cifs_readahead also calls\ncifs_readpage_from_fscache and *does* unconditionally release the lock\nafter its return.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: clean up potential nfsd_file refcount leaks in COPY codepath\n\nThere are two different flavors of the nfsd4_copy struct. One is\nembedded in the compound and is used directly in synchronous copies. The\nother is dynamically allocated, refcounted and tracked in the client\nstruture. For the embedded one, the cleanup just involves releasing any\nnfsd_files held on its behalf. For the async one, the cleanup is a bit\nmore involved, and we need to dequeue it from lists, unhash it, etc.\n\nThere is at least one potential refcount leak in this code now. If the\nkthread_create call fails, then both the src and dst nfsd_files in the\noriginal nfsd4_copy object are leaked.\n\nThe cleanup in this codepath is also sort of weird. In the async copy\ncase, we'll have up to four nfsd_file references (src and dst for both\nflavors of copy structure). They are both put at the end of\nnfsd4_do_async_copy, even though the ones held on behalf of the embedded\none outlive that structure.\n\nChange it so that we always clean up the nfsd_file refs held by the\nembedded copy structure before nfsd4_copy returns. Rework\ncleanup_async_copy to handle both inter and intra copies. Eliminate\nnfsd4_cleanup_intra_ssc since it now becomes a no-op.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix potential UAF of struct nilfs_sc_info in nilfs_segctor_thread()\n\nThe finalization of nilfs_segctor_thread() can race with\nnilfs_segctor_kill_thread() which terminates that thread, potentially\ncausing a use-after-free BUG as KASAN detected.\n\nAt the end of nilfs_segctor_thread(), it assigns NULL to \"sc_task\" member\nof \"struct nilfs_sc_info\" to indicate the thread has finished, and then\nnotifies nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() of this using waitqueue\n\"sc_wait_task\" on the struct nilfs_sc_info.\n\nHowever, here, immediately after the NULL assignment to \"sc_task\", it is\npossible that nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() will detect it and return to\ncontinue the deallocation, freeing the nilfs_sc_info structure before the\nthread does the notification.\n\nThis fixes the issue by protecting the NULL assignment to \"sc_task\" and\nits notification, with spinlock \"sc_state_lock\" of the struct\nnilfs_sc_info.  Since nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() does a final check to\nsee if \"sc_task\" is NULL with \"sc_state_lock\" locked, this can eliminate\nthe race.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (coretemp) Simplify platform device handling\n\nCoretemp's platform driver is unconventional. All the real work is done\nglobally by the initcall and CPU hotplug notifiers, while the \"driver\"\neffectively just wraps an allocation and the registration of the hwmon\ninterface in a long-winded round-trip through the driver core.  The whole\nlogic of dynamically creating and destroying platform devices to bring\nthe interfaces up and down is error prone, since it assumes\nplatform_device_add() will synchronously bind the driver and set drvdata\nbefore it returns, thus results in a NULL dereference if drivers_autoprobe\nis turned off for the platform bus. Furthermore, the unusual approach of\ndoing that from within a CPU hotplug notifier, already commented in the\ncode that it deadlocks suspend, also causes lockdep issues for other\ndrivers or subsystems which may want to legitimately register a CPU\nhotplug notifier from a platform bus notifier.\n\nAll of these issues can be solved by ripping this unusual behaviour out\ncompletely, simply tying the platform devices to the lifetime of the\nmodule itself, and directly managing the hwmon interfaces from the\nhotplug notifiers. There is a slight user-visible change in that\n/sys/bus/platform/drivers/coretemp will no longer appear, and\n/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.n will remain present if package n is\nhotplugged off, but hwmon users should really only be looking for the\npresence of the hwmon interfaces, whose behaviour remains unchanged.",

Stored frames can later be referenced by FTCH chunks. For files using subversion < 2, the undecoded frame is stored, and decoded again when the FTCH chunks are parsed. However, in process_frame_obj if the frame has an invalid size, there’s an early return, with a value of 0. \n\nThis causes the code in decode_frame to still store the raw frame buffer into ctx->stored_frame. Leaving ctx->has_dimensions set to false.\n\nA subsequent chunk with type FTCH would call process_ftch and decode that frame obj again, adding to the top/left values and calling process_frame_obj again.\nGiven that we never set ctx->have_dimensions before, this time we set the dimensions, calling init_buffers, which can reallocate the buffer in ctx->stored_frame, freeing the previous one. However, the GetByteContext object gb still holds a reference to the old buffer.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, when the code tries to decode the frame, codecs that accept a GetByteContext as a parameter will trigger a use-after-free read when using gb.\n\nGetByteContext is only used for reading bytes, so at most one could read invalid data. There are no heap allocations between the free and when the object is accessed.

This renders IP-based rate limiting ineffective against determined attackers. Litestar's RateLimitMiddleware uses `cache_key_from_request()` to generate cache keys for rate limiting. When an X-Forwarded-For header is present, the middleware trusts it unconditionally and uses its value as part of the client identifier. Since clients can set arbitrary X-Forwarded-For values, each different spoofed IP creates a separate rate limit bucket. An attacker can rotate through different header values to avoid hitting any single bucket's limit. This affects any Litestar application using RateLimitMiddleware with default settings, which likely includes most applications that implement rate limiting. Version 2.18.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.",

A file upload vulnerability in version 3.0.7 of FlowiseAI allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation. This enables attackers to persistently store malicious Node.js web shells on the server, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The system fails to validate file extensions, MIME types, or file content during uploads. As a result, malicious scripts such as Node.js-based web shells can be uploaded and stored persistently on the server. These shells expose HTTP endpoints capable of executing arbitrary commands if triggered. The uploaded shell does not automatically execute, but its presence allows future exploitation via administrator error or chained vulnerabilities. This presents a high-severity threat to system integrity and confidentiality. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.",

    "description": "python-socketio is a Python implementation of the Socket.IO realtime client and server. A remote code execution vulnerability in python-socketio versions prior to 5.14.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary Python code through malicious pickle deserialization in multi-server deployments on which the attacker previously gained access to the message queue that the servers use for internal communications. When Socket.IO servers are configured to use a message queue backend such as Redis for inter-server communication, messages sent between the servers are encoded using the `pickle` Python module. When a server receives one of these messages through the message queue, it assumes it is trusted and immediately deserializes it. The vulnerability stems from deserialization of messages using Python's `pickle.loads()` function. Having previously obtained access to the message queue, the attacker can send a python-socketio server a crafted pickle payload that executes arbitrary code during deserialization via Python's `__reduce__` method. This vulnerability only affects deployments with a compromised message queue. The attack can lead to the attacker executing random code in the context of, and with the privileges of a Socket.IO server process. Single-server systems that do not use a message queue, and multi-server systems with a secure message queue are not vulnerable. In addition to making sure standard security practices are followed in the deployment of the message queue, users of the python-socketio package can upgrade to version 5.14.0 or newer, which remove the `pickle` module and use the much safer JSON encoding for inter-server messaging.",

    "description": "Akka.NET is a .NET port of the Akka project from the Scala / Java community. In all versions of Akka.Remote from v1.2.0 to v1.5.51, TLS could be enabled via our `akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp` transport and this would correctly enforce private key validation on the server-side of inbound connections. Akka.Remote, however, never asked the outbound-connecting client to present ITS certificate - therefore it's possible for untrusted parties to connect to a private key'd Akka.NET cluster and begin communicating with it without any certificate. The issue here is that for certificate-based authentication to work properly, ensuring that all members of the Akka.Remote network are secured with the same private key, Akka.Remote needed to implement mutual TLS. This was not the case before Akka.NET v1.5.52. Those who run Akka.NET inside a private network that they fully control or who were never using TLS in the first place are now affected by the bug. However, those who use TLS to secure their networks must upgrade to Akka.NET V1.5.52 or later. One patch forces \"fail fast\" semantics if TLS is enabled but the private key is missing or invalid. Previous versions would only check that once connection attempts occurred. The second patch, a critical fix, enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) by default, so both parties must be keyed using the same certificate. As a workaround, avoid exposing the application publicly to avoid the vulnerability having a practical impact on one's application. However, upgrading to version 1.5.52 is still recommended by the maintainers.",

This vulnerability arises because the class allows the use of arbitrary XSLT stylesheets, which are parsed using lxml.etree.parse() and lxml.etree.XSLT() without any hardening measures. In lxml versions up to 4.9.x, external entities are resolved by default, allowing attackers to read arbitrary local files or perform outbound HTTP(S) fetches. In lxml versions 5.0 and above, while entity expansion is disabled, the XSLT document() function can still read any URI unless XSLTAccessControl is applied. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain read-only access to any file the LangChain process can reach, including sensitive files such as SSH keys, environment files, source code, or cloud metadata. No authentication, special privileges, or user interaction are required, and the issue is exploitable in default deployments that enable custom XSLT.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-iolatency: Fix memory leak on add_disk() failures\n\nWhen a gendisk is successfully initialized but add_disk() fails such as when\na loop device has invalid number of minor device numbers specified,\nblkcg_init_disk() is called during init and then blkcg_exit_disk() during\nerror handling. Unfortunately, iolatency gets initialized in the former but\ndoesn't get cleaned up in the latter.\n\nThis is because, in non-error cases, the cleanup is performed by\ndel_gendisk() calling rq_qos_exit(), the assumption being that rq_qos\npolicies, iolatency being one of them, can only be activated once the disk\nis fully registered and visible. That assumption is true for wbt and iocost,\nbut not so for iolatency as it gets initialized before add_disk() is called.\n\nIt is desirable to lazy-init rq_qos policies because they are optional\nfeatures and add to hot path overhead once initialized - each IO has to walk\nall the registered rq_qos policies. So, we want to switch iolatency to lazy\ninit too. However, that's a bigger change. As a fix for the immediate\nproblem, let's just add an extra call to rq_qos_exit() in blkcg_exit_disk().\nThis is safe because duplicate calls to rq_qos_exit() become noop's.",

This accesses the nf_ct_helper_hash dangling\npointer and causes a uaf, possibly leading to random memory corruption.\n\nThis patch guards nf_conntrack_helper_register() from accessing a freed\nor uninitialized nf_ct_helper_hash pointer and fixes possible\nuses-after-free when loading a conntrack module.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86: fix clear_user_rep_good() exception handling annotation\n\nThis code no longer exists in mainline, because it was removed in\ncommit d2c95f9d6802 (\"x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for user memory\nclearing\") upstream.\n\nHowever, rather than backport the full range of x86 memory clearing and\ncopying cleanups, fix the exception table annotation placement for the\nfinal 'rep movsb' in clear_user_rep_good(): rather than pointing at the\nactual instruction that did the user space access, it pointed to the\nregister move just before it.\n\nThat made sense from a code flow standpoint, but not from an actual\nusage standpoint: it means that if user access takes an exception, the\nexception handler won't actually find the instruction in the exception\ntables.\n\nAs a result, rather than fixing it up and returning -EFAULT, it would\nthen turn it into a kernel oops report instead, something like:\n\n    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000020081000\n    #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode\n    #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page\n    ...\n    RIP: 0010:clear_user_rep_good+0x1c/0x30 arch/x86/lib/clear_page_64.S:147\n    ...\n    Call Trace:\n      __clear_user arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess_64.h:103 [inline]\n      clear_user arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess_64.h:124 [inline]\n      iov_iter_zero+0x709/0x1290 lib/iov_iter.c:800\n      iomap_dio_hole_iter fs/iomap/direct-io.c:389 [inline]\n      iomap_dio_iter fs/iomap/direct-io.c:440 [inline]\n      __iomap_dio_rw+0xe3d/0x1cd0 fs/iomap/direct-io.c:601\n      iomap_dio_rw+0x40/0xa0 fs/iomap/direct-io.c:689\n      ext4_dio_read_iter fs/ext4/file.c:94 [inline]\n      ext4_file_read_iter+0x4be/0x690 fs/ext4/file.c:145\n      call_read_iter include/linux/fs.h:2183 [inline]\n      do_iter_readv_writev+0x2e0/0x3b0 fs/read_write.c:733\n      do_iter_read+0x2f2/0x750 fs/read_write.c:796\n      vfs_readv+0xe5/0x150 fs/read_write.c:916\n      do_preadv+0x1b6/0x270 fs/read_write.c:1008\n      __do_sys_preadv2 fs/read_write.c:1070 [inline]\n      __se_sys_preadv2 fs/read_write.c:1061 [inline]\n      __x64_sys_preadv2+0xef/0x150 fs/read_write.c:1061\n      do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline]\n      do_syscall_64+0x39/0xb0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80\n      entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\nwhich then looks like a filesystem bug rather than the incorrect\nexception annotation that it is.\n\n[ The alternative to this one-liner fix is to take the upstream series\n  that cleans this all up:\n\n    68674f94ffc9 (\"x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for small memory copies\")\n    20f3337d350c (\"x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for small memory clearing\")\n    adfcf4231b8c (\"x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for user memory copies\")\n  * d2c95f9d6802 (\"x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for user memory clearing\")\n    3639a535587d (\"x86: move stac/clac from user copy routines into callers\")\n    577e6a7fd50d (\"x86: inline the 'rep movs' in user copies for the FSRM case\")\n    8c9b6a88b7e2 (\"x86: improve on the non-rep 'clear_user' function\")\n    427fda2c8a49 (\"x86: improve on the non-rep 'copy_user' function\")\n  * e046fe5a36a9 (\"x86: set FSRS automatically on AMD CPUs that have FSRM\")\n    e1f2750edc4a (\"x86: remove 'zerorest' argument from __copy_user_nocache()\")\n    034ff37d3407 (\"x86: rewrite '__copy_user_nocache' function\")\n\n  with either the whole series or at a minimum the two marked commits\n  being needed to fix this issue ]",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Make bpf_refcount_acquire fallible for non-owning refs\n\nThis patch fixes an incorrect assumption made in the original\nbpf_refcount series [0], specifically that the BPF program calling\nbpf_refcount_acquire on some node can always guarantee that the node is\nalive. In that series, the patch adding failure behavior to rbtree_add\nand list_push_{front, back} breaks this assumption for non-owning\nreferences.\n\nConsider the following program:\n\n  n = bpf_kptr_xchg(&mapval, NULL);\n  /* skip error checking */\n\n  bpf_spin_lock(&l);\n  if(bpf_rbtree_add(&t, &n->rb, less)) {\n    bpf_refcount_acquire(n);\n    /* Failed to add, do something else with the node */\n  }\n  bpf_spin_unlock(&l);\n\nIt's incorrect to assume that bpf_refcount_acquire will always succeed in this\nscenario. bpf_refcount_acquire is being called in a critical section\nhere, but the lock being held is associated with rbtree t, which isn't\nnecessarily the lock associated with the tree that the node is already\nin. So after bpf_rbtree_add fails to add the node and calls bpf_obj_drop\nin it, the program has no ownership of the node's lifetime. Therefore\nthe node's refcount can be decr'd to 0 at any time after the failing\nrbtree_add. If this happens before the refcount_acquire above, the node\nmight be free'd, and regardless refcount_acquire will be incrementing a\n0 refcount.\n\nLater patches in the series exercise this scenario, resulting in the\nexpected complaint from the kernel (without this patch's changes):\n\n  refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.\n  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 207 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate+0xbc/0x110\n  Modules linked in: bpf_testmod(O)\n  CPU: 1 PID: 207 Comm: test_progs Tainted: G           O       6.3.0-rc7-02231-g723de1a718a2-dirty #371\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.15.0-0-g2dd4b9b3f840-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n  RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0xbc/0x110\n  Code: 6f 64 f6 02 01 e8 84 a3 5c ff 0f 0b eb 9d 80 3d 5e 64 f6 02 00 75 94 48 c7 c7 e0 13 d2 82 c6 05 4e 64 f6 02 01 e8 64 a3 5c ff <0f> 0b e9 7a ff ff ff 80 3d 38 64 f6 02 00 0f 85 6d ff ff ff 48 c7\n  RSP: 0018:ffff88810b9179b0 EFLAGS: 00010082\n  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000002 RCX: 0000000000000000\n  RDX: 0000000000000202 RSI: 0000000000000008 RDI: ffffffff857c3680\n  RBP: ffff88810027d3c0 R08: ffffffff8125f2a4 R09: ffff88810b9176e7\n  R10: ffffed1021722edc R11: 746e756f63666572 R12: ffff88810027d388\n  R13: ffff88810027d3c0 R14: ffffc900005fe030 R15: ffffc900005fe048\n  FS:  00007fee0584a700(0000) GS:ffff88811b280000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: 00005634a96f6c58 CR3: 0000000108ce9002 CR4: 0000000000770ee0\n  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n  PKRU: 55555554\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   bpf_refcount_acquire_impl+0xb5/0xc0\n\n  (rest of output snipped)\n\nThe patch addresses this by changing bpf_refcount_acquire_impl to use\nrefcount_inc_not_zero instead of refcount_inc and marking\nbpf_refcount_acquire KF_RET_NULL.\n\nFor owning references, though, we know the above scenario is not possible\nand thus that bpf_refcount_acquire will always succeed. Some verifier\nbookkeeping is added to track \"is input owning ref?\" for bpf_refcount_acquire\ncalls and return false from is_kfunc_ret_null for bpf_refcount_acquire on\nowning refs despite it being marked KF_RET_NULL.\n\nExisting selftests using bpf_refcount_acquire are modified where\nnecessary to NULL-check its return value.\n\n  [0]: https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20230415201811.343116-1-davemarchevsky@fb.com/",

This is then used to allocate a new SKB in\ncdc_ncm_fill_tx_frame() where all the data is handled.\n\nFor small values of dwNtbOutMaxSize the memory allocated during\nalloc_skb(dwNtbOutMaxSize, GFP_ATOMIC) will have the same size, due to\nhow size is aligned at alloc time:\n\tsize = SKB_DATA_ALIGN(size);\n        size += SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct skb_shared_info));\nThus we hit the same bug that we tried to squash with\ncommit 2be6d4d16a084 (\"net: cdc_ncm: Allow for dwNtbOutMaxSize to be unset or zero\")\n\nLow values of dwNtbOutMaxSize do not cause an issue presently because at\nalloc_skb() time more memory (512b) is allocated than required for the\nSKB headers alone (320b), leaving some space (512b - 320b = 192b)\nfor CDC data (172b).\n\nHowever, if more elements (for example 3 x u64 = [24b]) were added to\none of the SKB header structs, say 'struct skb_shared_info',\nincreasing its original size (320b [320b aligned]) to something larger\n(344b [384b aligned]), then suddenly the CDC data (172b) no longer\nfits in the spare SKB data area (512b - 384b = 128b).\n\nConsequently the SKB bounds checking semantics fails and panics:\n\nskbuff: skb_over_panic: text:ffffffff831f755b len:184 put:172 head:ffff88811f1c6c00 data:ffff88811f1c6c00 tail:0xb8 end:0x80 dev:<NULL>\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nkernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:113!\ninvalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN\nCPU: 0 PID: 57 Comm: kworker/0:2 Not tainted 5.15.106-syzkaller-00249-g19c0ed55a470 #0\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 04/14/2023\nWorkqueue: mld mld_ifc_work\nRIP: 0010:skb_panic net/core/skbuff.c:113 [inline]\nRIP: 0010:skb_over_panic+0x14c/0x150 net/core/skbuff.c:118\n[snip]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n skb_put+0x151/0x210 net/core/skbuff.c:2047\n skb_put_zero include/linux/skbuff.h:2422 [inline]\n cdc_ncm_ndp16 drivers/net/usb/cdc_ncm.c:1131 [inline]\n cdc_ncm_fill_tx_frame+0x11ab/0x3da0 drivers/net/usb/cdc_ncm.c:1308\n cdc_ncm_tx_fixup+0xa3/0x100\n\nDeal with too low values of dwNtbOutMaxSize, clamp it in the range\n[USB_CDC_NCM_NTB_MIN_OUT_SIZE, CDC_NCM_NTB_MAX_SIZE_TX].

This underflow subsequently\ncauses the 'bad_frame' checks in 'mt7601u_rx_skb_from_seg()' to be\nbypassed, eventually leading to a dereference of the pointer 'p', which\nis a null pointer.\n\nEnsure that 'dma_len' is greater than 'min_seg_len'.\n\nFound by a modified version of syzkaller.\n\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000008-0x000000000000000f]\nCPU: 0 PID: 12 Comm: ksoftirqd/0 Tainted: G        W  O      5.14.0+\n#139\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS\nrel-1.12.1-0-ga5cab58e9a3f-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:skb_add_rx_frag+0x143/0x370\nCode: e2 07 83 c2 03 38 ca 7c 08 84 c9 0f 85 86 01 00 00 4c 8d 7d 08 44\n89 68 08 48 b8 00 00 00 00 00 fc ff df 4c 89 fa 48 c1 ea 03 <80> 3c 02\n00 0f 85 cd 01 00 00 48 8b 45 08 a8 01 0f 85 3d 01 00 00\nRSP: 0018:ffffc900000cfc90 EFLAGS: 00010202\nRAX: dffffc0000000000 RBX: ffff888115520dc0 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffff8881118430c0 RDI: ffff8881118430f8\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000e09 R09: 0000000000000010\nR10: ffff888111843017 R11: ffffed1022308602 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000e09 R14: 0000000000000010 R15: 0000000000000008\nFS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88811a800000(0000)\nknlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 000000004035af40 CR3: 00000001157f2000 CR4: 0000000000750ef0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nPKRU: 55555554\nCall Trace:\n mt7601u_rx_tasklet+0xc73/0x1270\n ? mt7601u_submit_rx_buf.isra.0+0x510/0x510\n ? tasklet_action_common.isra.0+0x79/0x2f0\n tasklet_action_common.isra.0+0x206/0x2f0\n __do_softirq+0x1b5/0x880\n ? tasklet_unlock+0x30/0x30\n run_ksoftirqd+0x26/0x50\n smpboot_thread_fn+0x34f/0x7d0\n ? smpboot_register_percpu_thread+0x370/0x370\n kthread+0x3a1/0x480\n ? set_kthread_struct+0x120/0x120\n ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\nModules linked in: 88XXau(O) 88x2bu(O)\n---[ end trace 57f34f93b4da0f9b ]---\nRIP: 0010:skb_add_rx_frag+0x143/0x370\nCode: e2 07 83 c2 03 38 ca 7c 08 84 c9 0f 85 86 01 00 00 4c 8d 7d 08 44\n89 68 08 48 b8 00 00 00 00 00 fc ff df 4c 89 fa 48 c1 ea 03 <80> 3c 02\n00 0f 85 cd 01 00 00 48 8b 45 08 a8 01 0f 85 3d 01 00 00\nRSP: 0018:ffffc900000cfc90 EFLAGS: 00010202\nRAX: dffffc0000000000 RBX: ffff888115520dc0 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffff8881118430c0 RDI: ffff8881118430f8\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000e09 R09: 0000000000000010\nR10: ffff888111843017 R11: ffffed1022308602 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000e09 R14: 0000000000000010 R15: 0000000000000008\nFS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88811a800000(0000)\nknlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 000000004035af40 CR3: 00000001157f2000 CR4: 0000000000750ef0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nPKRU: 55555554",

    "id": "CVE-2025-61670",
    "description": "Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime 37.0.0 and 37.0.1 have memory leaks in the C/C++ API when using bindings for the `anyref` or `externref` WebAssembly values. This is caused by a regression introduced during the development of 37.0.0 and all prior versions of Wasmtime are unaffected. If `anyref` or `externref` is not used in the C/C++ API then embeddings are also unaffected by the leaky behavior. The `wasmtime` Rust crate is unaffected by this leak.\n\nDevelopment of Wasmtime 37.0.0 included a refactoring in Rust of changing the old `ManuallyRooted<T>` type to a new `OwnedRooted<T>` type. This change was integrated into Wasmtime's C API but left the C API in a state which had memory leaks. Additionally the new ownership semantics around this type were not reflected into the C++ API, making it leak-prone. A short version of the change is that previously `ManuallyRooted<T>`, as the name implies, required manual calls to an \"unroot\" operation. If this was forgotten then the memory was still cleaned up when the `wasmtime_store_t` itself was destroyed eventually. Documentation of when to \"unroot\" was sparse and there were already situations prior to 37.0.0 where memory would be leaked until the store was destroyed anyway. All memory, though, was always bound by the store, and destroying the store would guarantee that there were no memory leaks.\n\nIn migrating to `OwnedRooted<T>` the usage of the type in Rust changed. A manual \"unroot\" operation is no longer required and it happens naturally as a destructor of the `OwnedRooted<T>` type in Rust itself. These new resource ownership semantics were not fully integrated into the preexisting semantics of the C/C++ APIs in Wasmtime. A crucial distinction of `OwnedRooted<T>` vs `ManuallyRooted<T>` is that the `OwnedRooted<T>` type allocates host memory outside of the store. This means that if an `OwnedRooted<T>` is leaked then destroying a store does not release this memory and it's a permanent memory leak on the host.\n\nThis led to a few distinct, but related, issues arising: A typo in the `wasmtime_val_unroot` function in the C API meant that it did not actually unroot anything. This meant that even if embedders faithfully call the function then memory will be leaked. If a host-defined function returned a `wasmtime_{externref,anyref}_t` value then the value was never unrooted. The C/C++ API no longer has access to the value and the Rust implementation did not unroot. This meant that any values returned this way were never unrooted. The goal of the C++ API of Wasmtime is to encode automatic memory management in the type system, but the C++ API was not updated when `OwnedRooted<T>` was added. This meant that idiomatic usage of the C++ API would leak memory due to a lack of destructors on values.\n\nThese issues have all been fixed in a 37.0.2 release of Wasmtime. The implementation of the C and C++ APIs have been updated accordingly and respectively to account for the changes of ownership here. For example `wasmtime_val_unroot` has been fixed to unroot, the Rust-side implementation of calling an embedder-defined function will unroot return values, and the C++ API now has destructors on the `ExternRef`, `AnyRef`, and `Val` types. These changes have been made to the 37.0.x release branch in a non-API-breaking fashion. Changes to the 38.0.0 release branch (and `main` in the Wasmtime repository) include minor API updates to better accommodate the API semantic changes. The only known workaround at this time is to avoid using `externref` and `anyref` in the C/C++ API of Wasmtime. If avoiding those types is not possible then it's required for users to update to mitigate the leak issue.",

    "description": "Dependency-Track is a component analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Prior to version 4.13.5, Dependency-Track may send credentials meant for a private NuGet repository to `api.nuget.org` via the HTTP `Authorization` header, and may disclose names and versions of components marked as internal to `api.nuget.org`. This can happen if the Dependency-Track instance contains .NET components, a custom NuGet repository has been configured, the custom repository has been configured with authentication credentials, and the repository server does not provide `PackageBaseAddress` resource in its service index. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.13.5. Some workarounds are avaialble. Disable custom NuGet repositories until the patch has been applied, invalidate the previously used credentials, and generate new credentials for usage after the patch has been applied.",

    "description": "LLaMA-Factory is a tuning library for large language models. Prior to version 0.9.4, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the chat API allows any authenticated user to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal and external networks. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive internal services, reconnaissance of the internal network, or interaction with third-party services. The same mechanism also allows for a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, enabling users to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The vulnerability exists in the `_process_request` function within `src/llamafactory/api/chat.py.` This function is responsible for processing incoming multimodal content, including images, videos, and audio provided via URLs. The function checks if the provided URL is a base64 data URI or a local file path (`os.path.isfile`). If neither is true, it falls back to treating the URL as a web URI and makes a direct HTTP GET request using `requests.get(url, stream=True).raw` without any validation or sanitization of the URL. Version 0.9.4 fixes the underlying issue.",

A BPv7 bundle with a malformed extension block causes uncontrolled memory allocation inside ION-DTN 4.1.3s, leading to receiver thread termination and a Denial-of-Service (DoS). The triggering bundle contains an extension block starting at `0x85070201005bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`. The first byte in the extension block (0x85) indicates a CBOR array of five elements of which the first four are numbers (0x07, 0x02, 0x01, 0x00) but the fifth element is a byte string of length 27 (`0x5bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`). The vulnerability seems to be due to processing the fifth element of the array (i.e., the byte string) as replacing it with a number makes the vulnerability no longer be triggered. While parsing this extension block, ION obtains a very large block length, which in the code in `bei.c`:764) seems to be passed from `blockLength` which is an unsigned int, to a 32 bit signed integer `blkSize`. The unsigned to signed conversion causes `blkSize` to hold the value of -369092043, which is then converted into a 64-bit unsigned value inside `MTAKE(blkSize)`, resulting in an attempt to allocate an unrealistic amount of memory, causing the error.

    "description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. In versions prior to 2.5.3 and 2.2.15, `Deno.FsFile.prototype.stat` and `Deno.FsFile.prototype.statSync` are not limited by the permission model check `--deny-read=./`. It's possible to retrieve stats from files that the user do not have explicit read access to (the script is executed with `--deny-read=./`). Similar APIs like `Deno.stat` and `Deno.statSync` require `allow-read` permission, however, when a file is opened, even with file-write only flags and deny-read permission, it's still possible to retrieve file stats, and thus bypass the permission model. Versions 2.5.3 and 2.2.15 fix the issue.",

This may lead to users accidentally publishing media not meant for publishing, and thus possibly exposing internal media. This risk of this actually impacting someone is very low, though. This can only be triggered by users with write access to an event. They also have to use the editor, which is usually an action taken if they want to publish media and not something users would use on internal media they do not want to publish. Finally, they have to first click on \"Save & Publish\" before then selecting the \"Save\" option. Nevertheless, while very unlikely, this can happen. This issue is fixed in Opencast 17.8 and 18.2.",

    "description": "CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 (32-bit builds) contained a malicious pre-entry-point loader that diverts execution from __scrt_common_main_seh into a custom loader. That loader decodes an embedded blob into shellcode, allocates executable heap memory, resolves Windows API functions at runtime, and transfers execution to an in-memory payload. The payload performs anti-analysis checks, gathers host telemetry, encodes the data with a two-stage obfuscation, and attempts HTTPS exfiltration to hard-coded C2 servers or month-based DGA domains. Potential impacts include remote data collection and exfiltration, stealthy in-memory execution and persistence, and potential lateral movement. CCleaner was developed by Piriform, which was acquired by Avast in July 2017; Avast later merged with NortonLifeLock to form the parent company now known as Gen Digital. According to vendor advisories, the compromised CCleaner build was released on August 15, 2017 and remediated on September 12, 2017 with v5.34; the compromised CCleaner Cloud build was released on August 24, 2017 and remediated on September 15, 2017 with v1.07.3214.",

The fetched script conditionally loaded follow-on modules that performed extensive ad substitution and malvertising, displayed fake “repair” alerts that redirected users to affiliate programs, and attempted to harvest credentials when users logged in. Injected components enumerate common banner sizes for substitution, replace third-party ad calls, and redirect victim traffic to affiliate landing pages. Potential impacts include user-level code execution in the browser context, large-scale ad fraud and traffic hijacking, credential theft, and exposure to additional payloads delivered by the actor. The compromise was reported on by the maintainer of Web Developer for Chrome on August 2, 2017 and remediated in v0.5.0.",

In both cases zpci_register_ioat()\nfails with a cc value indicating that the device handle is invalid.

    "description": "New API is a large language mode (LLM) gateway and artificial intelligence (AI) asset management system. An authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.9.0.5. A feature within the application allows authenticated users to submit a URL for the server to process its content. The application fails to properly validate this user-supplied URL before making a server-side request. This vulnerability is not limited to image URLs and can be triggered with any link provided to the vulnerable endpoint. Since user registration is often enabled by default, any registered user can exploit this. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can coerce the server to send requests to arbitrary internal or external services. The vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.0.5. The patch introduces a comprehensive, user-configurable SSRF protection module, which is enabled by default to protect server security. This new feature provides administrators with granular control over outbound requests made by the server. For users who cannot upgrade immediately, some temporary mitigation options are available. Enable new-api image processing worker (new-api-worker) and/or configure egress firewall rules.",

In versions prior to 1.3.26, unauthenticated attackers can create or modify API keys for any user by passing that user's id in the request body to the `api/auth/api-key/create` route. `session?.user ?? (authRequired ? null : { id: ctx.body.userId })`. When no session exists but `userId` is present in the request body, `authRequired` becomes false and the user object is set to the attacker-controlled ID. Server-only field validation only executes when `authRequired` is true (lines 280-295), allowing attackers to set privileged fields. No additional authentication occurs before the database operation, so the malicious payload is accepted. The same pattern exists in the update endpoint. This is a critical authentication bypass enabling full an unauthenticated attacker can generate an API key for any user and immediately gain complete authenticated access. This allows the attacker to perform any action as the victim user using the api key, potentially compromise the user data and the application depending on the victim's privileges. Version 1.3.26 contains a patch for the issue.",

    "description": "Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, a possible information disclosure vulnerability existed in `Rack::Sendfile` when running behind a proxy that supports `x-sendfile` headers (such as Nginx). Specially crafted headers could cause `Rack::Sendfile` to miscommunicate with the proxy and trigger unintended internal requests, potentially bypassing proxy-level access restrictions. When `Rack::Sendfile` received untrusted `x-sendfile-type` or `x-accel-mapping` headers from a client, it would interpret them as proxy configuration directives. This could cause the middleware to send a \"redirect\" response to the proxy, prompting it to reissue a new internal request that was not subject to the proxy's access controls. An attacker could exploit this by setting a crafted `x-sendfile-type: x-accel-redirect` header, setting a crafted `x-accel-mapping` header, and requesting a path that qualifies for proxy-based acceleration. Attackers could bypass proxy-enforced restrictions and access internal endpoints intended to be protected (such as administrative pages). The vulnerability did not allow arbitrary file reads but could expose sensitive application routes. This issue only affected systems meeting all of the following conditions: The application used `Rack::Sendfile` with a proxy that supports `x-accel-redirect` (e.g., Nginx); the proxy did **not** always set or remove the `x-sendfile-type` and `x-accel-mapping` headers; and the application exposed an endpoint that returned a body responding to `.to_path`. Users should upgrade to Rack versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, which require explicit configuration to enable `x-accel-redirect`. Alternatively, configure the proxy to always set or strip the header, or in Rails applications, disable sendfile completely.",

    "description": "Astro is a web framework. Prior to version 5.14.2, Astro reflects the value in `X-Forwarded-Host` in output when using `Astro.url` without any validation. It is common for web servers such as nginx to route requests via the `Host` header, and forward on other request headers. As such as malicious request can be sent with both a `Host` header and an `X-Forwarded-Host` header where the values do not match and the `X-Forwarded-Host` header is malicious. Astro will then return the malicious value. This could result in any usages of the `Astro.url` value in code being manipulated by a request. For example if a user follows guidance and uses `Astro.url` for a canonical link the canonical link can be manipulated to another site. It is theoretically possible that the value could also be used as a login/registration or other form URL as well, resulting in potential redirecting of login credentials to a malicious party. As this is a per-request attack vector the surface area would only be to the malicious user until one considers that having a caching proxy is a common setup, in which case any page which is cached could persist the malicious value for subsequent users. Many other frameworks have an allowlist of domains to validate against, or do not have a case where the headers are reflected to avoid such issues. This could affect anyone using Astro in an on-demand/dynamic rendering mode behind a caching proxy. Version 5.14.2 contains a fix for the issue.",

A Node.js VM Context is not an isolated environment, and if the user runs untrusted JavaScript code within the Happy DOM VM Context, it may escape the VM and get access to process level functionality. It seems like what the attacker can get control over depends on if the process is using ESM or CommonJS. With CommonJS the attacker can get hold of the `require()` function to import modules. Happy DOM has JavaScript evaluation enabled by default. This may not be obvious to the consumer of Happy DOM and can potentially put the user at risk if untrusted code is executed within the environment.

    "description": "python-ldap is a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) client API for Python. In versions prior to 3.4.5, the sanitization method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` can be tricked to skip escaping of special characters when a crafted `list` or `dict` is supplied as the `assertion_value` parameter, and the non-default `escape_mode=1` is configured. The method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` supports 3 different escaping modes. `escape_mode=0` (default) and `escape_mode=2` happen to raise exceptions when a `list` or `dict` object is supplied as the `assertion_value` parameter. However, `escape_mode=1` computes without performing adequate logic to ensure a fully escaped return value. If an application relies on the vulnerable method in the `python-ldap` library to escape untrusted user input, an attacker might be able to abuse the vulnerability to launch ldap injection attacks which could potentially disclose or manipulate ldap data meant to be inaccessible to them. Version 3.4.5 fixes the issue by adding a type check at the start of the `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` method to raise an exception when the supplied `assertion_value` parameter is not of type `str`.",

    "description": "Poppler ia a library for rendering PDF files, and examining or modifying their structure. A use-after-free (write) vulnerability has been detected in versions Poppler prior to 25.10.0 within the StructTreeRoot class. The issue arises from the use of raw pointers to elements of a `std::vector`, which can lead to dangling pointers when the vector is resized. The vulnerability stems from the way that refToParentMap stores references to `std::vector` elements using raw pointers. These pointers may become invalid when the vector is resized. This vulnerability is a common security problem involving the use of raw pointers to `std::vectors`. Internally, `std::vector `stores its elements in a dynamically allocated array. When the array reaches its capacity and a new element is added, the vector reallocates a larger block of memory and moves all the existing elements to the new location. At this point if any pointers to elements are stored before a resize occurs, they become dangling pointers once the reallocation happens. Version 25.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.",

    "description": "External Secrets Operator reads information from a third-party service and automatically injects the values as Kubernetes Secrets. A vulnerability was discovered in the BeyondTrust provider implementation for External Secrets Operator versions 0.10.1 through 0.19.2. The provider previously retrieved Kubernetes secrets directly, without validating the namespace context or the type of secret store. This allowed unauthorized cross-namespace secret access, violating security boundaries and potentially exposing sensitive credentials. In version 0.20.0, the provider code was updated to use the `resolvers.SecretKeyRef` utility, which enforces namespace validation and only allows cross-namespace access for `ClusterSecretStore` types. This ensures secrets are only retrieved from the correct namespace, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access. All users should upgrade to the latest version containing this fix. As a workaround, use a policy engine such as Kyverno or OPA to prevent using BeyondTrust provider and/or validate the `(Cluster)SecretStore` and ensure the namespace may only be set when using a `ClusterSecretStore`.",
